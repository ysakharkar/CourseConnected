# CourseConnected

CourseConnected is a web application that allows users to pool data from various common online learning sources like YouTube, Khan Academy, MathIsFun, etc. and even your own sources, like personal pictures and videos, to put together structured courses that can then be shared with the community for all to use. 

The frontend is built on React, Node, and CSS, whereas its backend uses Express alongside database functionalities on MongoDB.
